Week two

Made it through week one and was excited for week two. Currently, I was feeling confident and was eager for the next challenge in my journey. On the first day of this week, the class was introduced to Functions and Object-Oriented Programming. Although a bit confusing at first, I began to understand well after the instructor took the time to explain the process of functions in detail. We continued to dive deep into these topics throughout the week. Given that I had extraordinarily little coding experience before my journey at DigitalCrafts, I struggled as we delved deeper. However, practice makes perfect so I continued to practice as much as I could. On day three of week two, the class was informed about our upcoming group project which required each group to create an RPG game. This news was intimidating, given that we were just two weeks into programming. Challenge accepted! All along, class exercises and homework were individual projects but with a group project, students learn other skills besides coding. A group project helps teaches and improves communication, time management, leadership skills, and team building. Also, a group project gives a glimpse into the nature of programming in a working environment. One the meeting with my group, I realized these benefits instantly. Oh, and did I mention that my group members were extremely intelligent and hardworking!
