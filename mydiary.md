Week one
Its week one and here i am on my journey to become a programmer. The first week of the class introduced me to the basics of writing and executing codes in the command line. The first hurdle I faced on this topic was getting the right technology for work so I can follow along with the class. After I overcame this hurdle with assistance from instructors and teaching assistants, I was able to follow along although it was a bit tough to retain all the commands for executing codes in the command line. As with everything, practice makes perfect so I spent some time revising what I learned in class and that helped with my understanding of the process. Unfortunately, I missed the second and third day of class and that set me back further than I expected. The issue with missing class is that I had to catch up on what I missed to be able to code along for the rest of the week. My absence from class meant I missed the introduction to very important topics on Git and introduction to python. For the rest of the week, I found it difficult to understand these topics and that affected my productivity. Also, Coding Bootcamp is fast-paced so lacking behind can affect how well you perform in the end. Overall, I learned so much in week one. I will continue to practice and improve so as far as i do not quit!
